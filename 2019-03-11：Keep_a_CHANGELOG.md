> 別讓你的朋友把 git log 扔到 changelog

### change log
- curated
- 依時間排序出專案中每一個版本需要注意的 changes

### point
要讓 users and contributors 能清楚地看出專案的每個 release (or version) 的 changes

### Why should I care?
Because software tools are for people. If you don’t care, why are you contributing to open source? 

### A good change log
- 給人看得，不是給機器看的。所以`易讀性`很關鍵
- 輕易的 link 到每一區塊（所以 md 比 plain text 更好）
- 每一個 version 一個 sub-section
- List 反序（最新在最上面）
- 所有日期格式就是 `YYYY-MM-DD` (Example: 2012-06-02)，這是
  - international 的格式
  - sensible
  - language-independent
  - ISO 8601
- 明確提出專案是否 follows `Semantic Versioning`
- 每個版本應該要：
  - List 出 release date
  - 分類列出 changes，描述這些 change 的影響，如下
  - `Added` for new features.
  - `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
  - `Deprecated` for once-stable features removed in upcoming releases.
  - `Removed` for deprecated features removed in this release.
  - `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
  - `Security` to invite users to upgrade in case of vulnerabilities.


### 如何省事點？
把 `Unreleased` section 保持在最上面。

- User 看到會期待下一次 release
- 要 release 的時候，就直接把 `Unreleased` 改為`版號`，然後新增新的 `Unreleased` 區

### bad
- Dumping a diff of commit logs
- 沒有強調 deprecations 給 User 知道，log 一定要 painfully clear。
- 日期格式！日期格式！日期格式！（上面有寫 format）


### 檔案名稱
`CHANGELOG.md` is the best convention so far.  
大寫是吸引 user 注意力。小寫像是在講 function name。  

### 如果 yanked（撤下） releases?
標記 `YANDED`、log 方面建議保留在上面。
