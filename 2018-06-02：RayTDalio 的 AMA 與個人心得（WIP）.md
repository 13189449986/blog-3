How do I know I am Right ? Find people disagree with me, demarcracy

 > I can assure you that it has been critical in improving my equanimity and creativity, which has been essential to whatever success I’ve had. Almost every person who I’ve introduced it to who has given it a fair chance finds it invaluable. My family and colleagues practice it because they like it (and not because I tell them to). There is only so much convincing I can give you in words (my friend Bob Roth also summarized the research well in his book Strength in Stillness), so the only way to really find out is to do it and see how it feels.

 > Evolving well and contributing to evolution. At this stage in my life, my most important objective is to transition well to have other people be successful without me. I expect to do this for about another year and go quiet, while continuing to pursue my various other passions.

 ## Do you have any suggestions on what we can do to shorten the time to have deeper comprehension on a subject?
 - 有很多痛苦經驗、越快越好。「躲避痛苦」是學習上非常好的激勵因子。
 > Have as many painful experiences as rapidly as possible. Pain avoidance is a great motivator for learning.

 ## How much role do you think the concept of 'compounding' has played in your success ?
  - compound one’s learning 最好的方法是寫下它、把它放到 演算法algorithms 裡。無論目前的我有多成功，這在我所做的事情中是「極為重要(enormously important)」的。

 ##
 - 我會弄一個 dot collector (聽起來應該是 Ray 在橋水弄的一個 flow，詳細運作模式大家也在思考。要看書 or [TED Ray talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/ray_dalio_how_to_build_a_company_where_the_best_ideas_win) 有提到)並且一年當中所有我能使用的工具。 On using at home, there are limits to how crazy I will get.

 > I will be making the dot collector and all of my tools available within a year. On using at home, there are limits to how crazy I will get.

 > Dive into the markets, have the shit kicked out of you, and learn how to do things differently. One of my most basic formulas for life is Pain + Reflection = Progress. And by the way, when you create reflections that give you principles for how to do things better in the future, be sure to write them down.

 > Though the amount of debt is important, even more important is whether or not that debt is denominated in your own currency. That is because if it is denominated in ones own currency, policy makers have numerous ways of spreading it out so that it doesn’t sink the economy. The most important question for those who do have debt denominated in their own currency is whether they have the skill, wisdom, and political system that allows them to manage that well. Concerning your question about China, from my contact, I believe that they have all the right ingredients to manage their debts well.

 > It would be: “recognize that you are a dumb shit doesn’t nearly what you need to know in order to have the life you want to have and that life is an adventure in which making mistakes and knowing how to learn from that is the best part.”

 > Re: Northeast, it is a true story; I did buy a little bit of its stock when I was 12 because I caddied at the time and people talked about the stock market. I bought the shares because my dad, who was a jazz musician, introduced me to a kind broker he knew who helped me do that. I bought it for the stupid reason that it was the only company I’d heard of that was selling for less than 5/share, so I thought that if it went up, I would make more money. I got lucky because it was about to go bankrupt and then was acquired by another company, and then I was hooked on playing the market.

 > Almost all of my days are very different from each other, other than having breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but they are all consistently in pursuit of 4 or 5 big missions that excite me.

 > I call them five Cs—character, curiosity, creativity, common-sense, and consideration.

 > I don’t think you learn the most from an MBA anyway. And I do think you learn a lot from the most basic experiences. You can work yourself up from running a little store or other simple experiences, and you can go online and get wonderful courses on any skill that you want to acquire. Also, look around you and find your role models and ask them what principles led them to be successful.

 > Yes—and it’s still not easy.

 > Meaningful work and meaningful relationships. When I look back on my life and the various accomplishments I’ve made and impacts I’ve had, the most important source of happiness for me has been the wonderful relationships I’ve had and continue to have, whether that’s with my family, with my friends, or with my communities.

 > The ocean has a tremendous rejuvenative capacity if it is not abused continuously, so I believe the best path is to help people help the world fall in love with it and want to protect it. That’s what I’m on a mission to do.

 > Work it through with them appealing to both their logic and emotions. For most people, there is an emotional barrier that stands in the way of their wanting the transparency that gives everyone awareness (for example, do you want people to know your weaknesses? Do you want people to know your mistakes? Many people will say no but few can describe why that’s better for the organization). If you can’t reach an agreement, you will have to move on to what you do about it. To me, being radically truthful and radically transparent is important and defines the culture that I’m in, so people who can’t adapt to this might have to leave. Typically, most people can understand intellectually that it is best for the community and initially try it, and then come to love it.

 ## 對投資者而言，最重要的原則為：
  1. 知道如何平衡你的「投資組合」，這樣在面對任何 bull 或 bear markets 時，才不會有 systematic bias 。
  2. 別犯思考錯誤，投資(n.)已經比過去幾年還要好，而不是 expensive investments。思考如何旋轉你的「投資組合」來買低賣高。
  
 ##  how can I get the most out of my college years?
 - 瘋狂的 party 吧，最重要的是交朋友與你的體驗，別把畢業做為最高優先。

 ## Hi Ray, do you workout? About halfway through your book, really like it.
  - 這是我其中一個最大的缺點，沒有像我工作時一樣的「戒律discipline」來「運動」。

 > Live by them yourself so that you are a good role model. Additionally, I would recommend you and they see the “Principles for Success” animation and talk about it because many people told me that that was invaluable for watching with your kid.

 > Whenever I’m in a position in which too many choices are coming at me at once to handle them all well (which is most of the time like it is for most people), it forces me up to the higher level to reflect on my priorities and organize myself to reject good alternatives. If you have my book Principles, there’s one about this idea, Prioritize: While you can have virtually anything you want, you can’t have everything you want.

 > The key to whatever success I’ve had has to do more with my dealing how to do with my not knowing than anything I know. While the power of a visionary “shaper” is great, it is nowhere near as powerful as the collection of independent-minded shapers who know how to disagree well and then get beyond their disagreements to make the best decisions. In addition, if you don’t have people who can think for themselves, you won’t have great leverage and you won’t build a great organization. You also won’t have them devoted to the mission. So I believe an idea meritocracy is so much more powerful than organizations that resemble feudal monarchies.

 > Three great books were:
 > Lessons from History by Will and Ariel Durant, which is a 104-page distillation of the themes of history by great historians who covered 500 years of history in all countries.
 > A River From Eden by Richard Dawkins, which in a little over 100 pages covers all evolution of all life through time.
 > Joseph Campbell’s Hero of a Thousand Faces, which looks at the archetypical life evolutions of all heroes through different civilizations through time.

  > I think if you think about just the most important things that are happening to you and you write down principles for all of them, you’re bound to have a large number accumulated over a lifetime. Like most things in life there is a hierarchy of principles that goes form the few most important ones down to increasingly granular ones. To be most effective, I believe one has to have both and communicate both, which is why when I wrote the book I used a hierarchical form that allows the reader to review just the most important ones in a matter of minutes or to delve into them in whatever level of granularity they choose. It’s also the reason why I distilled them down into the videos.

  > For 1): I think it’s really important for children in school to learn that making mistakes is part of the learning process, that everybody has strengths and weaknesses, and I think it’s also important for them to learn how to think creatively for themselves rather than just follow instructions. I think that the school learning process often fails students in making them learn what the teacher wants them to remember and think that making mistakes is bad and a sign of their inadequacy.
 > 3) What’s most key for me is having meaningful work and meaningful relationships, so I like to visualize incredible things that I can make happen and eliminate the gap with what exists to make them happen, and I like to do that with people who are on that mission with me. It doesn’t matter in what area or what profession, as long as I have those things.
 > For example, right now I’m on a mission to make people realize and feel that ocean exploration is even more exciting and more important than space explorations, and I will do that.

 > I’d just dive in and place bets know how to learn from my experiences. I wrote about how to do that in my book, which is largely about how to convert mistakes into learned principles that work, and how to save these principles and use them in computers so that your thinking is not constrained by your brain’s capacity to juggle a lot of things at the same time.
 > There is no better learning than that which comes from experiences and quality reflections on those experiences. It doesn’t matter whether you do it at a hedge fund, or any other place, but I would recommend that you do it around other smart people who help you brainstorm on the best answer.

 > About 30 years ago I learned that I could take the written principles I’d been recording and put them into equations in the computer that allowed them to think in parallel with me. I believe that you can learn to do this without knowing how to write the algorithms yourself by working with people who know how to convert thoughts into algorithms and I urge you to do this.
 > I believe that the future will be significantly enhanced by having knowledgeable, experienced people who don’t know the language of algorithms working with the next generation who knows the language but doesn’t have the knowledge and wisdom that they need. These partnerships are invaluable.

 > To know how to simultaneously think for yourself and know that you know virtually nothing so that you have to take in the best thinking that’s available to you and critically analyze it.

 > Instincts and intuition are very important. They come from the subliminal mind and are brought to the surface and have to be reconciled with the logical, conscious mind. When the two are aligned, I’m ready to go.

 > I believe it extends to everything in life. You got to get the basic fundaments crystal clear. Someone said that any damn fool can make it complicated, it takes a genius to make it simple.

 > In 6 to 12 months, but in the meantime you might want to take a look at 30 minute distilled version of my Economic Principles at economicprinciples.org.

 > I wanted to pass along the principle that brought me the success you’re referring to in both a very simple form and a very comprehensive form so that everyone could have the access to the version the find most appropriate.

 > Everyone faces a tradeoff between the amount of time and the depth of understanding in order to understand a subject. I believe that in order to communicate effectively with anyone, you’ve got to give them the choice between comprehensive and simple, which is why I did it both ways. I did this first with “How the Economic Machine Works” that received 5.5 mil views and told people everything important that I knew about economics and decided to do it again with “Principles for Success” which distilled my 600 page book down to 30 minutes. I believe that it’ll always be true that doing it both ways will be best.
